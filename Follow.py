# A* Search Solution for Tutorial sample #7: The Maze Decorator

# Note: I wrote this code quickly, and did a simple pass to make sure it's somewhat readable.
# Probably not as efficient or optimized as it could be (almost sure of it).
# I bet there are multiple places it could be improved, feel free to do whatever you'd like with it.
